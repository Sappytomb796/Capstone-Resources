What kind of projects are you interested in?
	I am open to a lot of different projects, and I think it would really depend on a case by case basis. Something involving cryptography or quantum computing would be my highest interest, but a project using ML or AI would also be interesting as well.

If you are not working, what is your hardest class? What is one thing you love and one thing you hate?
	Hardest class this term is probably cryptography or number theory. I love math and computers, and hate getting sick.
