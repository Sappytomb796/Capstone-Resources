* What skills/kinds of projects you are interested in for capstone
        - I'm here to learn how to lead and to be a mentor.  I'm really
	  interested in security and low level/systems programming and
	  networking.  But my focus is on the first part of that since
	  I already have an industry job in what I like.
* If you are working, where are you working and what is something you love about
  your job, and something you hate?
	- I work at Intel on ethernet drivers.  I work with the Linux
	  community and am a tree maintainer.  My responsibilities
	  include communication with customers and the community,
	  debugging code, and packaging drivers.
	- One thing I love is the constant challenge of new things and things
	  changing through innovation.
	- One thing I hate is the push I get from the Customer team, PAE,
	  to deliver things quicker than they can physically be done.

	  responses from people

Nicholas Gilbert
* What skills/kinds of projects you are interested in for capstone:
	- Something low level, systems programming is extremely interesting
	  to me
	- Not much experience with web dev, would be interested in it to learn,
	  might good for a project
	- Something in a functional language or paradigm
	  (might be a stretch that might not actually happen)
* If you are working, where are you working and what is something you love
  about your job, and something you hate?
	- I work at a company called CorVel doing system administration. It's
	  really tangential to development work, but I have gotten opportunities
	  to develop and deploy developed projects.
	     - Love:
		- Developing an Outlook extension, packaging it up for an
		  enterprise environment, and deploying it to production.
	     - Hate:
		- Early on especially, felt more like a support role than an
		  administration role, but it has expanded to a more
		  administration/development role.

	  all have to do often!
