This is the process once code is written that we should be following to review
code.  Updates to the review process now that we have our feet under us will
be updated and noted here.  There are a few instances that this model will
not be appropriate for review, special circumstances can be worked out with
the team lead otherwise this is the model we should follow.


1.  Code written and pushed to appropriate dev branch

2.  Pull request submitted on github

3.  Kraken card placed into the Pull Request column

4.  2 Reviews must be completed to merge into the master branch
    i.  When a reviewer reviews the code, they should keep in mind
    	if the commit message is clear and matches what the code is
	doing.  If the reviewer has questions, they should ask them.
    ii. When the reviewer is satisfied with the code in the state it's in, 
    	they should add the Reviewed-by: name <email> line into the comments

5.  Pull request submitter can merge into master, if they do not merge before
    the following meeting it will be merged at the meeting as part of standup.

6.  Can move Kraken card to merged

7.  Integration testing on the robot should be done as close as possible to 
    merge

8.  If integration testing shows any bugs or things that need to be updated 
    or optimized, new cards on kraken should be created in the needs picked
    up column

9.  The card for the original commit can be moved to the done done column
