Commit messages:
Title line should start with "Resources: " and then a one line description.  
There should then be a blank line.  After that, a short description of what your
commit is adding.  You should then add the line "Signed-off-by: " followed by 
your name and email formated like this: <email@example.com> Lines should not
exceed 80 characters.  There are commits already in place that follow this 
format, please see them as a starting refference.

File types to upload:
.txt and .pdf are the most accessible.  If you are submitting a .txt file, do 
not let lines exceed 80 characters.  This seems like a picky thing, this is
the standard for the kernel and helps to keep things a little more readable.
