\section*{Guiding Principles}
\noindent Resolving disagreements rather than buring them\\
over riding concern is meeting the sponsor's needs\\
Look for what will work, not what is wrong\\
Speak positively about the team and the organization at every opportunity\\
Help each other be right, not wrong\\
Look for solutions to problems that come up rather than finding fault\\
All members should feel good about this experience\\
Training gives us skills and confidence\\
