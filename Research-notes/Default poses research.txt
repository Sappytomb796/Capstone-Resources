1. Where is the code that we would modify?

    * Actions: ~/catkin_ws/src/ROBOTIS-OP3/op3_action_module/data/motion_4095.bin
    * Action module to control actions: ~/catkin_ws/src/ROBOTIS-OP3/op3_action_module/src/action_module.cpp
    * This is binary data. Need to use the action_editor module to edit and add poses
    * Command: roslaunch op3_action_editor op3_action_editor.launch
    * Currently cannot run. Recieving "Error Set port". May not happen with actual robot.

2. Can we define a default pose?

    * Section 5.6 in Robotis Tutorials
    * Use action editor to create new actions / edit actions
    * Also, init pose looks to be defined in a yaml file. Maybe we can define a default in another yaml.

3. What can we assume when saying it is in a default? (e.x. can we assume that it can flow between poses to get upright)

    * Poses are loaded from the binary file in the action_module.cpp file. Trajectories are calculated in base_module.
        Maybe we can add a function in one of these to generate a pose to get to a goal position. 

4. What should the default pose be?

    * It seems the initial pose is the best pose to use as a default (standing mostly upright). 

5. Adding a default, what code do we need to change to invoke that it goes to a default pose?

    * Init pose info is saved in a yaml file in base module. This is loaded in for any function where initial
        pose is called. Should be able to call our default pose when actions are dispatched.

Poses

1. Where is the code located that stores a pose?

    * Action(pose): ~/catkin_ws/src/ROBOTIS-OP3/op3_action_module/data/motion_4095.bin

2. Is it feasible to add new poses?

    * New poses can be added with the action_editor module
    * feasible, just takes time. Creating an action involves creating a series of changes in joint angle resolution

3. What things would we need to add to be able to invoke the newly added pose?

    * Action module to control actions: ~/catkin_ws/src/ROBOTIS-OP3/op3_action_module/src/action_module.cpp
    * Above file dispatches actions. Appears to pull actions directly from motion_4095.bin.
        Just need to invoke by action name / page number.
    * op3 base module: ~/catkin_ws/src/ROBOTIS-OP3/op3_base_module/src/base_module.cpp
        * This seems to be the file that controls joint trajectory calc, initial pose loading, etc.

4. Where are those places located?

* Note: op3_manager.cpp line 168 checks if robot
