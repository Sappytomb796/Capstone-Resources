Defaults:
1. Add function between action call and execution. Determine from action name if default pose should be executed first
2. Pull in target pose in init function from YAML file
3. Get current joint angles to generate initial position
4. Maybe call initPoseTrajGenerateProc() to calculate the movement from init to target
* base_module.cpp/initPoseTrajGenerateProc() -> Seems to generate movement between init pose and target

Use Cases:
1. Don't want robot to fall on face when thanking from rest pose
2. Want robot to go back to init if in the middle of another pose
