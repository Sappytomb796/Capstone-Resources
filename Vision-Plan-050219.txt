Plan / Ideas for getting over hurdle of current data set being BGR causing a potentially incorrect model:

Option 1:
    a) Modify image saving callback to save in RGB instead of BGR
    b) Retake dataset, with additional light scenarios with reflection shining off of the ball
    c) Tweak model analysis to account for more than just B value
    d) Create new model and import with current ball detection modifications

Option 2:
    a) Create script / small program using OpenCV imread and imwrite to take existing dataset from BGR to RGB
    b) Steps c and d from Option 1

=============================

After hurdle:

- Define method for tracking whether a detection is "good" ie. a circle is detected within the same range for X processing cycles
    - Could use circles_ vector as a starting point to load into our own structure
    - If not "good", re-run through function
