* What skills/kinds of projects you are interested in for capstone:
    - Something low level, systems programming is extremely interesting to me
    - Not much experience with web dev, would be interested in it to learn, 
      might good for a project
    - Something in a functional language or paradigm 
      (might be a stretch that might not actually happen)
* If you are working, where are you working and what is something you love 
  about your job, and something you hate? 
    - I work at a company called CorVel doing system administration. It's 
      really tangential to development work, but I have gotten opportunities
      to develop and deploy developed projects.
    - Love:
        - Developing an Outlook extension, packaging it up for an enterprise
          environment, and deploying it to production.
    - Hate:
        - Early on especially, felt more like a support role than an
          administration role, but it has expanded to a more administration
          / development role.
