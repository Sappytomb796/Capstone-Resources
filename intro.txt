* What skills/kinds of projects you are interested in for capstone
        - I'm here to learn how to lead and to be a mentor.  I'm really
	  interested in security and low level/systems programming and
	  networking.  But my focus is on the first part of that since
	  I already have an industry job in what I like.
* If you are working, where are you working and what is something you love about
  your job, and something you hate?  
       I work at Intel on ethernet drivers.  I work with the Linux community and
       am a tree maintainer.  My responsibilities include communication with 
       customers and the community, debugging code, and packaging drivers.
       One thing I love is the constant challenge of new things and things
       changing through innovation.  One thing I hate is the push I get 
       from the Customer team, PAE, to deliver things quicker than they can 
       physically be done.
