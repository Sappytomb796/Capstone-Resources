Key Requirements:
	- Data sourced from server
	- Web-based
	- Dynamic representation
	- Generated reports
	- Multiple language support

Liberties:
	- Front-end and back-end implementation choice
	- How the data is representated
	
Roadblocks:
	- Heavy emphasis on the front-end representation of data
	- Graphically arranging large amounts of data logically
		- Nesting data according to category
		- Developing an interface to inspect specific
			categories
		- Creating generic representations for similar
			data types
	- Aesthetic yet functional interface
		- Avoid data saturation (current implementation)
	- Communicating with data server
