# Project Proposal Thoughts

# Day 1

## Nike - Diversity and Inclusion App

Vague, open ended for the worst.

Big dislike, 1 / 10.

## VA - Tinnitus Care Plan

Building on existing capstone software, pilot testing and database creation.
Seems reasonably scoped.

8 / 10.

## STREET SMARTS

Move an existing site to a new CMS + lots of feature creep.
Doesn't seem feasible for this project scope.

1 / 10.

## City of Portland - Hate Incidents Reporting App

Kinda vague, but not super bad. Not the worst.

3 / 10.

## City of Portland - Urban Performance Dashboard

Pretty good, reasonably scoped. Reactive web dashboard

Proof of concept

7 / 10.

## Bart - Capstone Review System

Well specced, seems doable. Interface using apache on the backend, minimal js frontend, python backend

8 / 10.

(I should have taken more notes day one, but the worst ones were clearly off the table)

# Day 2

## Intel - Robot Project

Enhance an existing south korean robot
Improve vision algorithm for soccer playing mode
Replicate pose demo, adding a replay mode. Very machine learning-esque.

Not from scratch, building and integration on improving

Tiny humanoid robot
Running on Linux, C++, ROS, Dynamic SDK

Support team in China

Seems really difficult, but really cool, but well scoped in what is expected.

## Tufte + Tankha - PSU-Connect App

Anthropologist project, based on anthropology project. Researched by PSU students.
Online surveys, interviews, focus group, participant observation, spatial mapping, network mapping, social media research
Fostering community on a campus

Problem: connectivity on campus

The thing: New PSU-Connect App with a Social Platform approach

- Things
    - Student Profile
        - "facebook" or linkedin
        - Connect with other students
    - Master PSU google calendar
    - Individual virtual planner
        - Links to classes, etc
    - Campus Connect
        - like craigslist
        - Rideshare
        - buy/sell
        - Study buddies
    - Student services
        - Jobs, internships
        - Financial aid info
        - Payment function
        - Saving discounts
        - Commuter

- Primary requirements
    - App or Responsive mobile friendly site
    - Details:
        - Android iOS or Responsive all acceptable
        - Open source (license negotiable)
        - Flexible in technology
        - Provide input into app/website design
    - Pick and choose from things above

- Sponsor
    - Engagement
        - Weekly meetings with sponsor team
        - Slack or similar for urgent questions
        - Periodic input from students who developed ideas

- Main thoughts:
    - Seems somewhat doable if feature creep is quelled. Tufte is willing to negotiate actual requirements / which features are feasible.
    - Would not prioritize, but would not mind getting stuck

Solid 5, maybe 6 / 10.

## Brentwood Group - Adopt One Block

"Adopt a highway" like thing

Problem: dirty streets

Solution: provide a technology framework, infrastructure to allow people to "adopt one block"

- Point and click sign-up, make it use to select a block through gmap interface
- No framework to select a square block
    - Make that framework to automate drawing of blocks within google maps

The problem seems kinda cool. And reasonably scoped

6 / 10.

## Joe Fusion - Systems Science - Open Source Python Package for OCCAM

Systems science research software improvement

Existing open source team

- OCCAM
    - Reconstrutability analysis software
        - Machine learning method from the sys science community
        - Probabilistic graphical modeling
        - Good at
            - Handling qualitative data
            - finding non-linearities
            - Produces interpretable models easy to understand and explain
            - Data mining, searching through many models
    - Software implementation of this method
        - C++ app with python wrapper

        - Established research tool
        - Recently released as open source
    
- what they want
    - python package in the middle
        - Suitable for inclusion in a major repository
        - standard structure, interface, i/o
        - plays nicely with other ML & data structures
    - Well organized open-source project
    - ready for the future
        - move engine to python
        - switching to better libs for math and stats
        - more power, tensor

occam-ra.io

Thoughts: old codebase, but could be a fun trashfire to tackle and improve

## Beautiful Portland - Non-profit Website

Feeding the homeless / food insecure

Super new 501-3 non-profit

Soup

Thoughts: seems simple enough, most should be possible.

Seems like a good cause.
