Research into potential issues or roadblocks that may be encountered for the
OCCAM Python Package Project

- Roadblocks
    - Existing python is kind of a huge mess
        - Particularly the web-interfacing
            https://github.com/occam-ra/occam/blob/master/py/weboccam.py
        - Inconsistent style with some vague function wide operation descript-
          -ion but little documentation on inner functionality.
        - This might prove difficult to recreate into a package format
            - ie, there will need to be significant time spent to understand
              the current version in order to refactor into a new package
            - Starting from scratch will be necessary, but not before underst-
              -anding existing operation
        - Inconsistent style between files, seems there was little standards
          set for contribution to this project set thus far
            - Definitely feels like a project started from 1990, spaghetti bu-
              -ilt onto spaghetti
        - However, there is a good amount of additional documentation written
          recently for operation, which may make the inner working of the python
          eventually evident
            https://github.com/occam-ra/occam/tree/master/doc
    - Current git repo doesn't have much set form for committing or flow, lots
      of commits directly onto master it appears. Bart's contributions are the
      ones that adhere to more OSS standards, but many of the others do not.
        - Recently there seems to be the flow of using forked versions that get
          pull requested into current master, but no separate branches on the
          regular repository, which might be an issue to conform to if we were
          to contribute (forks effectively acting as branches)
    - Currently only seven lifetime issues in the repository, there may be more
      existing issues unreported.

- Specifications
  - Python package interfacing python interface, web interface, and C++ OCCAM engine
  - Standard package structure, open source
  - Compatibility with Machine Learning and data python packages
