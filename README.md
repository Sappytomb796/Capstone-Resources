# Capstone-Resources
Team Resources

Each member should have their own branch, for any notes they want to take, and then compiled team notes will occupy the master branch.  

When making your branch, please use your first-last name in all lowercase (ex. alice-michael).
To make your own branch:
   git checkout -b name-for-branch

Pushing your branch to github:
   git push origin name-for-branch

Merging master into your branch (Note: make sure you are on the branch you 
want to change)
     git checkout user-name-branch
     git merge --no-ff master

Team notes will include:
     * Planning Documents
     * Meeting Notes
     * Agendas
